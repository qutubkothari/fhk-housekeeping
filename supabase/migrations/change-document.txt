Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Housekeeping, Inventory & Linen Management System
Platform: Web Application + Mobile PWA (Arabic + English)
________________________________________
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This SRS defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a simplified Housekeeping, Inventory, and Linen Management system designed for organizations with untrained or minimally trained staff. The goal is to digitize operational activities that are currently executed completely manually (receipts, issues, stock tracking, linen logging, room allocation, guest requests, complaints, etc.).
1.2 Scope
The system will provide:
•	Consumable & equipment inventory tracking
•	Linen stock management and laundry cycle tracking
•	Housekeeping room assignment, cleaning workflow & supervisor inspection
•	Guest request and breakdown logging with routing
•	Supervisory dashboards & reports
•	Web Admin Panel (Supervisor / Management)
•	Mobile PWA (for HK staff) with full Arabic interface
The system must remain simple, fast, and usable by laymen.
1.3 Users
•	Admin / Management
•	Housekeeping Supervisor
•	Housekeeping Staff
•	Linen Attendant
•	Maintenance Staff (for breakdown requests)
1.4 Definitions
•	PWA: Progressive Web App
•	Inventory Item: Consumable or equipment
•	Linen Item: Bedsheets, pillows, towels, duvets, etc.
•	Transaction: Receive / Issue / Damage / Discard
________________________________________
2. System Overview
The system consists of two applications:
1.	Web Admin Panel – Supervisors and management use this to manage inventory, linen, staff, assignments, and reports.
2.	Mobile PWA (Arabic Default) – Used by staff to update room cleaning status, issue/receive stock, report breakdowns, and submit linen counts.
Both apps sync with a cloud backend database (e.g., Supabase or Firebase).
